## HashMap Vs TreeMap

```
HashMap allows a single null key and multiple null values. TreeMap does not allow null keys but can have multiple null values. HashMap allows heterogeneous elements because it does not perform sorting on keys. TreeMap allows homogeneous values as a key because of sorting.
```

## HashSet Vs TreeSet

```
1
Implementation 
Hash set is implemented using HashTable 
The tree set is implemented using a tree structure. 
2
Null Object 
HashSet allows a null object 
The tree set does not allow the null object. It throws the null pointer exception. 
3
Methods 
Hash set use equals method to compare two objects 
Tree set use compare method for comparing two objects. 
4
Heterogeneous object 
Hash set doesn't now allow a heterogeneous object 
Tree set allows a heterogeneous object 
5
Ordering 
HashSet does not maintain any order 
TreeSet maintains an object in sorted order
