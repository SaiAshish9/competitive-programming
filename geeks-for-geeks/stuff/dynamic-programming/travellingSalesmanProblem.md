# Travelling Salesman Problem

```

Naive Solution:
1) Consider city 1 as the starting and ending point.
2) Generate all (n-1)! Permutations of cities.
3) Calculate cost of every permutation and keep track of minimum cost permutation.
4) Return the permutation with minimum cost.

Time Complexity: Î˜(n!)

DP

If size of S is 2, then S must be {1, i},
 C(S, i) = dist(1, i) 
Else if size of S is greater than 2.
 C(S, i) = min { C(S-{i}, j) + dis(j, i)} where j belongs to S, j != i and j != 1.
