# NP Hard Vs NP Complete

```

Time required to complete a problem into another problem in order
to solve it is called reduction time

if all of the NP classes can be reduced to Pi classes. then Pi is called NP hard

NP hard problem may or may not be at NP class


NP Complete -> should be at NP class 

```

```

P problem -> can be solved in polynomial time

Shortest Path v^2

NP problems -> can be verified in polymonial time

solution cannot be available in polynomial time

TSP
TOH

NP Complete ->

Clique
